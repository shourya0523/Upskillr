## Overview & Key Principles

- **Technical Focus:** Deepen skills in ML, Python, and cloud computing (AWS Certification) while deploying real-world projects.
- **Entrepreneurial Focus:** Develop a startup mindset, create a product (MVP) or research proposal (GSoC), and refine business plans.
- **Academic Alignment:** Align tasks with your college calendar. During administrative deadlines (May), focus on minimal technical tasks and planning. Use intense summer sessions for deep work and reserve lighter weeks for reflection.
- **Redundancy:** In case internships or GSoC opportunities don’t materialize, you’ll have an alternate path (open-source fellowship, personal MVP, or competitive projects).
- **Tracking & Adaptability:** Use Notion for weekly planning and tracking, integrate KPIs and reflections, and update a web dashboard for an at-a-glance view.
